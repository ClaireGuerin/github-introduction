# Introduction to Github

## Description
*In this section, give details on what your code / program does, what you and other people can use it for, maybe some references or links.*

Congratulations! You are now a GitHub user and know how to use version control on your code!
This repository was created as part of an introductory course to git and GitHub. It contains:
- the current README as an example of what kind of information to put in a README
- a LICENSE
- a .gitignore file
- the presentation material, with key elements to get started on git and GitHub 
- a mock R code with absolutely nothing useful in it (`mysimpleprogram.R`).

## Visuals
*Here you can include some graphs / visual output or snapshots of your program if you have any.*

## Installation
*How to install this program? List all the necessary steps for a novice to be able to use your program on their own machine.*

Simply download the repository and place it wherever you want on your machine.

### Requirements
*Do you need to install any third-party software and/or packages?*

The code was written with R 3.6.3, under Ubuntu (20.04.2 LTS), but should work with other distributions.

## Usage
*Give information on how to use your program, some examples if applicable.*

### R code
From the command line: `R mycode.R`
From R or RStudio: source the code.

### Presentation
Open the slideshow in your preferred PDF reader or in the browser.
