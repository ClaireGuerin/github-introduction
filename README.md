# Introduction to Github

## Description
*In this section, give details on what your code / program does, what you and other people can use it for, maybe some references or links.*

Congratulations! :clap: You are now a GitHub :octocat: user and know how to use version control for your code!
This repository was created as part of an introductory course to git and GitHub. It contains:
- the current README as an example of what kind of information to put in a README
- a LICENSE
- a .gitignore file
- the presentation material, with key elements to get started on git and GitHub 
- a mock R code with absolutely nothing useful in it (`mysimpleprogram.R`).
- an image folder (img) with screenshots used in this README

## Installation
*How to install this program? List all the necessary steps for a novice to be able to use your program on their own machine.*

If you want to keep this repository as a reference to go back to when you have a **Git Existential Crisis**, you can star this repository to find it back more easily. Otherwise, if you want to play with the mock R program or have the PDF presentation locally, simply download the repository and place it wherever you want on your machine.

**Click "Star" on the top right side of the repository homepage:**

### R code
From the command line: `R mycode.R`
From R or RStudio: source the code.
