# Introduction to Github

## Description
*In this section, give details on what your code / program does, what you and other people can use it for, maybe some references or links.*

Congratulations! :clap: You are now a GitHub :octocat: user and know how to use version control for your code!
This repository was created as part of an introductory course to git and GitHub. It contains:
- the current README as an example of what kind of information to put in a README
- a LICENSE
- a .gitignore file
- the presentation material (`Introduction to Github.pdf`), with key elements to get started on git and GitHub 
- a cheatsheet for a useful [workflow](https://github.com/ClaireGuerin/github-introduction/blob/main/gitmasterflow.pdf)
- a small R script that will print a random quote on your screen (`quote.R`).
- a small R script that will print essential git commands on your screen (`githelp.R`)
- an image folder (img) with screenshots used in this README

## Installation
*How to install this program? List all the necessary steps for a novice to be able to use your program on their own machine.*

If you want to keep this repository as a reference to go back to when you have a **Git Existential Crisis**, you can star this repository to find it back more easily. Otherwise, if you want to play with the mock R program or have the PDF presentation locally, simply download the repository and place it wherever you want on your machine.

**Click "Star" on the top right side of the repository homepage:**

### Requirements
*Do you need to install any third-party software and/or packages?*

The code was written with R 3.6.3, under Ubuntu (20.04.2 LTS), but should work with other distributions.

## Usage
*Give information on how to use your program, some examples if applicable.*

### R code
From the command line (recommended): 
- `Rscript quote.R` will print a random quote in the terminal window.
- `Rscript githelp.R` will print a small cheatsheet of essential git commands in the terminal window.

From R or RStudio: source the code. This can be useful if you are working in RStudio and want to version control changes to your program, but don't remember how to use git.

### Presentation
Open the slideshow in your preferred PDF reader or in the browser.

## Roadmap
*Next steps for your program?*

Make a small R package out of the git cheatsheet `githelp.R`.

## Support
